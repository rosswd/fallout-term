# Fallout Terminal Web Version
Fallout Terminal was inspired by a challenge on /r/DailyProgrammer. My first attempt
was written in python and is available [fallout-pwd](https://github.com/rosswd/fallout-pwd).

This version is written in jQuery and will run in any web browser. It's a work
in progress and is not finished yet.
