# Fallout Terminal Web Version
Fallout Terminal was inspired by a [challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3qjnil)
on /r/DailyProgrammer. My first attempt was written in python and is available in the
[fallout-pwd](https://github.com/rosswd/fallout-pwd) repository.

This version is written in jQuery and will run in any web browser. It's a work
in progress and is not finished yet.

## Markup
I use classes for CSS, where possible, and add ids only for working with Javascript.
These ids generally take this type of form `js-topic-type`, for example, let's
say I have a div(type) which will contain results(topic) then my id would be
`js-results-div`.
